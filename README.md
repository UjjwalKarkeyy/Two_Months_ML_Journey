# Two Months ML Journey: Building Confidence for a Career in Machine Learning

## Welcome to My Journey
This repository chronicles my **2-month project-based learning journey** to build the skills and confidence needed to become a Junior Machine Learning (ML) Engineer.  

As a third-year student with foundational ML knowledge (e.g., familiar with the Iris dataset), Iâ€™m not aiming to master ML in just two months, thatâ€™s a lifelong pursuit! Instead, this journey is about proving 
to myself and future employers, especially at **Nepali AI/ML companies** like *Fusemachines, NAAMII, Cedar Gate, Paaila Technology, and more*, that I have the drive, skills, and potential to contribute to 
the industry.

This README is a living document, updated regularly as I progress through prerequisite revision, complete projects, and achieve milestones. Each project emphasizes **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to 
uncover data insights, followed by model building, evaluation, and deploymentâ€”mirroring real-world ML workflows.  

My journey begins with refreshing core skills to ensure a strong foundation for the exciting projects ahead.

## Why This Journey?

- **Purpose**: To develop a portfolio of 4-5 industry-relevant ML projects, mastering skills like EDA, preprocessing, modeling, and deployment, while building confidence as an ML practitioner.  
- **Nepal Focus**: Projects address local challenges, such as agriculture (crop disease detection) and customer support (chatbot), aligning with Nepalâ€™s AI/ML industry needs.  
- **Mindset**: This is a marathon, not a sprint. Every dataset explored, plot created, and model trained fuels my belief that I can become an ML Engineer.

## Current Focus: Prerequisite Revision [**Status**: Ongoing]
Iâ€™m starting by revisiting foundational skills to ensure Iâ€™m ready for project-based learning. This phase (2-3 days) focuses on strengthening my Python, data handling, and ML basics, preparing me for EDA-heavy projects like **Titanic Survival Prediction** and **Crop Disease Detection**.
### Skills Being Revised
- **Python**: Variables, loops, functions, list comprehensions, error handling.  
- **Data Handling**: Pandas (filtering, grouping, handling missing values), NumPy (array operations).  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib and seaborn for scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps.  
- **ML Basics**: Loading datasets (e.g., Iris), basic algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees), and evaluation metrics (accuracy, MSE).  
- **Tools Setup**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, scikit-learn, TensorFlow.  

### Practice Tasks
- Load and explore the Iris dataset (scikit-learn).  
- Create visualizations (e.g., scatter plot of sepal vs. petal length, histogram of features).  
- Build a simple classifier (e.g., logistic regression) on Iris and evaluate accuracy.  
- Document findings in a notebook to kickstart my portfolio.  

### Resources
- Kaggle, YouTube, Google, Scikit-Learn.
